# Welcome to @sankhyatronics/OmniPortal

**OmniPortal** is a high-performance, pure-view React component library designed for building dynamic portals driven by headless CMS or static JSON data.

## Why OmniPortal?

Unlike traditional UI libraries, OmniPortal is built with **Dynamic Rendering** as a first-class citizen. Every component is designed to be easily mapped to a JSON structure, allowing you to change your entire website's layout and content without touching a single line of React code.

### Core Philosophy

1.  **JSON-Driven**: Layouts are defined in JSON, making them perfect for Headless CMS integrations.
2.  **Pure View**: Components focus on presentation, allowing the application layer to handle logic and data fetching.
3.  **Themable**: Built with CSS variables and Tailwind support for deep customization.
4.  **Markdown-Ready**: Content blocks natively support Markdown for rich, formatted text.
