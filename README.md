> **The JSON-Powered Engine for Modern Portals.**

SankhyaCMS is an open-source React component library and rendering engine designed to build highly dynamic, high-performance portals. It decouples your UI structure from your application code by using a JSON-driven architecture.

## 🚀 Vision
Built for the era of Headless CMS, SankhyaCMS allows developers to provide non-technical editors with total control over layouts and content without the complexity of traditional "page builders."

## 📦 Project Structure
This repository is a monorepo managed with `pnpm`:
- `/SankhyaUI`: The core `@sankhyatronics/SankhyaUI` library.
- `/Stories`: Comprehensive Storybook documentation and testing suite.
- `/sampleweb`: A reference implementation app showing SankhyaCMS in action.

## 🛠 Features
- **Pure View Components**: React 19 components with zero side effects.
- **Dynamic Renderer**: A central engine to convert JSON structures into rich UI.
- **Markdown Support**: Native Markdown rendering in content blocks.
